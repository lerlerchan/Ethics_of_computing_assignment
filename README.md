# Ethics_of_computing_assignment
Project Overview: 

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are increasingly used in academic writing. In response, tools like Turnitin have introduced AI detection features. However, the inner workings of these detectors are not transparent, raising ethical concerns about fairness, accuracy, and academic integrity. 

 

In this project, students will: 

Explore the concept of AI-generated content detection from an ethical and technical perspective. 

Critically analyse the implications of using such tools in academic settings. 

Design a simple prototype (inspired by tools like BadStudent.ai or Grammarly) that helps students "humanize" AI-generated text to make it more natural, personal, and ethically aligned.
